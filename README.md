# ben.cv

This is the [Ghost](https://ghost.org) for my blog at [ben.cv](https://ben.cv).

## Deployment

Zip up the theme with this command:

```sh
npm run build && zip -r ben.cv-ghost.zip *
```

Then upload in the Ghost dashboard.

Also, upload the `routes.yaml` file in the dashboard (currently under Settings > Labs > Routes).
